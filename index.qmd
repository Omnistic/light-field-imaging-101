## Motivation

This tutorial aims to provide a didactic introduction to unfocused light-field (plenoptic 1.0) image processing in Python. While valuable resources exist, including the Light-Field Imaging Toolkit in MATLAB [@bolan2016light] and the informative website [plenoptic.info](https://www.plenoptic.info/), there remains an opportunity for educational materials that build understanding systematically from first principles. By presenting concepts in a structured, accessible format with Python examples, this guide seeks to complement existing academic literature.

## Raw images

Throughout this tutorial the following synthetic images will be used. A typical image of the raw light-field as acquired by the sensor

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple array
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Simple plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('A Simple Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

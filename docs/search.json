While valuable resources exist, including the Light-Field Imaging Toolkit in MATLAB (Bolan et al. 2016) and the informative website plenoptic.info, there remains an opportunity for educational materials that build understanding systematically from first principles. By presenting concepts in a structured, accessible format with Python examples, this guide seeks to complement existing academic literature."

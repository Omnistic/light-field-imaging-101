    "text": "This tutorial aims to provide a didactic introduction to light-field imaging fundamentals in Python. While valuable resources exist, including the Light-Field Imaging Toolkit (Bolan et al. 2016) and the informative website plenoptic.info, there remains an opportunity for educational materials that build understanding systematically from first principles. By presenting concepts in a structured, accessible format with Python examples, this guide seeks to complement existing academic literature. The focus throughout is on developing an intuitive grasp of light-field principles, connecting theoretical foundations with practical implementations in Python, and creating a resource suitable for those new to the field."
